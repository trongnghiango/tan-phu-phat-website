## What?

We try to emphasize that these files are javascript for a reason, by explicitly declaring its type (`cjs` or `mjs`) depending on what's supported by the library it is used by. Also, all the `js` files in this project are still typechecked using a `@ts-check` comment at the top.

## What's next? 

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with the most basic configuration and then move on to more advanced configuration.
